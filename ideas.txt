Man in Hole: The protagonist starts in a good situation, encounters a problem, descends into a low point, and then rises back up. Example: "The Lord of the Rings."

Cinderella: Begins low, rises, falls, and then rises again. Example: "Cinderella."

Tragedy: A constant rise followed by a sudden fall. Example: "Romeo and Juliet."

Rags to Riches: A rise from humble beginnings to success. Example: "The Pursuit of Happyness."

Riches to Rags: The opposite of "Rags to Riches," involving a fall from wealth. Example: "The Great Gatsby."

Icarus: Constant rise leading to an inevitable fall due to hubris. Example: "Macbeth."

Man in a Hole (Alternate): Similar to the first but without the final rise. Example: "Requiem for a Dream."

Certainly! Here's a list of various point-of-view techniques used in literature:

First Person:

The narrator is a character in the story, using "I" or "we" to tell the tale. Example: "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger.
Second Person:

The narrator directly addresses the reader using "you." Example: "If on a winter's night a traveler" by Italo Calvino.
Third Person Limited:

The narrator is an outsider who sees into the mind of one character. Example: "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee.
Third Person Omniscient:

The narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of all characters. Example: "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen.
Third Person Objective:

The narrator is an observer and does not know the thoughts or feelings of the characters. Example: "The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway.
Stream of Consciousness:

The narrative mimics the flow of thoughts in a character's mind. Example: "Ulysses" by James Joyce.
Epistolary:

The story is conveyed through a series of documents (letters, diary entries). Example: "Dracula" by Bram Stoker.
Multiple Perspectives:

The story is told from the viewpoints of different characters. Example: "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell.
Unreliable Narrator:

The narrator's credibility is compromised, intentionally or unintentionally. Example: "Fight Club" by Chuck Palahniuk.
Detached Observer:

The narrator is an observer but doesn't delve into characters' thoughts. Example: "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Peripheral Narrator:

The narrator is a secondary character on the periphery of the main story. Example: "The Great Gatsby" (Nick Carraway).
Collective or Plural First Person:

A group of narrators speaks as "we" rather than as individual "I"s. Example: Jeffrey Eugenides' "The Virgin Suicides."

Point of View (POV):

As mentioned earlier, POV determines the vantage point from which the story is narrated. First person, second person, and third person (limited, omniscient, and objective) are common POV techniques.
Stream of Consciousness:

This technique presents a character's thoughts and feelings in a continuous, unbroken flow, often resembling the way thoughts naturally occur in the mind. It provides insight into a character's inner world.
Flashback and Flashforward:

Flashbacks involve interrupting the chronological sequence to depict events that occurred in the past. Flashforwards, on the other hand, show events that will happen in the future. These techniques provide context and build suspense.
Foreshadowing:

Authors use hints or clues about future events to create anticipation and build tension in the narrative. Readers may not fully understand the significance until later in the story.
Epistolary Writing:

In an epistolary narrative, the story is told through a series of documents, such as letters, diary entries, or newspaper articles. This technique offers a unique perspective and can create a sense of immediacy.
Symbolism and Imagery:

Symbolism involves using objects, characters, or situations to represent deeper meanings. Imagery employs vivid and descriptive language to create mental images that enhance the reader's experience.
Dialogue:

Dialogue is the conversation between characters. Skillful use of dialogue can reveal character traits, advance the plot, and convey information in a dynamic and engaging manner.
Frame Story:

A frame story is a narrative within a narrative. It involves a main story that contains one or more embedded stories. This technique adds layers to the storytelling.
Unreliable Narrator:

An unreliable narrator provides a narrative that may be distorted, mistaken, or biased. This technique can create suspense and invite readers to question the credibility of the storytelling.
Parallel Storylines:

Multiple storylines run concurrently, sometimes intersecting or influencing each other. This technique allows for the exploration of different perspectives or themes.
Montage:

Montage involves the rapid sequence of images or scenes to convey a complex idea or the passage of time. It's often used in visual storytelling but can be adapted to literature.
